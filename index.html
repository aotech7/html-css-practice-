    <h2> 
        Hi, I am a developer that loves clean and elegant code. 
    </h2>
    <h2>
        A little about me.
    </h2>
    <p>
        My tech journey started with a degree in journalism. I loved researching, writing, and sharing my voice online, but something felt missing. I wished for a way to share and display information exactly the way I wanted. That's when I
        discovered and fell in love with coding and web design!
    </p>
    <p>
        As a front end developer, I pride myself on writing code that's easy to read and build upon while still looking great. My goal with every site is to provide a top-of-the-line user experience. Besides web development, I enjoy gardening and spending time with my small (but growing!)  family.
